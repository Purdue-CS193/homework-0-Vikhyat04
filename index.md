# Me in a few words

## Introduction
I am Vikhyat, a freshman at Purdue University who is excited to attend the fantastic 19300 CS course at Purdue. Even though we are just navigating through Github, I can't wait to upload all sorts of projects. Just joking...but the project and Purdue part is true. 


## A bit about me
I am a freshman who loves movies, food and maybe books. But most of all, I simply love sports-both watching and playing. Badminton, Tennis, Basketball, ping pong are just a few sports I play. Even though I am not the professional type, you will still find me at the corec quite a lot(unless hw screws me over). Gym is definetly not my cup of tea but I might try it out in the near future. Track is more my type but still, I love all outdoor things(hate yoga and meditiation and all things slow). Apart from that, I love talking. Even though I don't talk much the first time I meet you, the more I get to know you, the more I talk. And I guess that's it about me....
